<p>Controlling servos via UDP and motor with ESP32 and Godot
<p>Attempt at a RC control, the ESP side sends sensor data and has has connections to a DC motor and 2 servos. 
<p>This was intended to control a RC V wing (which has only one Motor and 2 servos to control movement).
<p>The repository root contains the godot code, but the platformio project is nested in the "board folder".
